# nodered
This folder contains the following

* `docker` - submodule with the nodered docker repo https://github.com/node-red/node-red-docker
* `docker-custom` - adjusted files for the nodered docker repo to build my custom image. It reflects the last changes I did thus the last image I published to dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/darignac/node-red
* `flows` - my exported nodered flows
